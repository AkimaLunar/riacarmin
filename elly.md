I worked on a project that needed a solid user research foundation. Elly was a code name for a travel application, and the team needed to tap into user behaviours around planning trips. The project started with requirements workshop, where we identified the scope. I've helped with qualitative and quantitative user research and drawing insights from it, and finally, interface suggestions.
