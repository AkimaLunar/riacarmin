“Women spend $100 per month on beauty and skin care, but they waste up to 75% of what they buy! A lot of women’s skin issues are self-inflicted and not genetic.” said the founder of the Beauty Sphere when she first presented her project to me. I could relate to these words. This was definitely an underserved market.

>The platform enabled women to make informed product choices supplemented with personalized tips and reminders

I had extensive research on the topic on my hands to work with. My job was to design a platform that would educate women and let them make informed choices in skin care to prevent self-inflicted issues with skin.

>The idea was to use the existing database of ingredients and provide recommendations based on user’s specific skin type and lifestyle

<strong>Onboarding</strong> First challenge I had is designing an onboarding experience that would deliver the results to the users with as little as possible time spent on filling out forms.

I wireframed several possible options working close with the founder and using her expertise in skincare. In the final solution I used simple, three-step form flow that adjusts based on users’s previous answers.

<strong>Visual Design</strong> The design of the main dashboard had to highlight the best products for the user and also allow filtering and search. For the best browsing experience I mixed in personalized tips and reminders right into the product grid. The user had the total control over results by filtering by brands, product type and budget.

I wanted to design style guides for the project so when the project grows the design remains consistent. I was inspired by shades of skin and used warm blush colors throughout my designs.

The final iteration of the platform enabled women to make informed product choices supplemented with personalized tips and reminders based on their lifestyle.
