<p class="text__caption">The day of the Rally in front of the Supreme Court.</p>

FightForFamilies was a fantastic project and an incredible opportunity to build tech for immigration coalition. In the light of the Supreme Court hearing on DACA+/DAPA case, the coalition needed a central hub to keep reporters, supporters and activists updated on the course of the case. FightForFamilies was meant to be a common denominator for every organization involved in immigration issues.

The project started with a requieremnt workshop during which we have identified the user groups we wanted to cater to and identified the content categories. Our team has conducted an extensive content audit, and we were able to pull in data from different departments, and also different coalition groups.

The branding that our team has created had to be available to activists from other coalition, so we have created a style guide with easily downloadable and reusable assets.

The culmination of the project was the Rally in front of the Supreme Court, where all the coalition members gathered to convince the Juctices to keep the families together.
