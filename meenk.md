<strong>Meenk is my personal project. It is an experiment with new ideas for social experiences.</strong>

There is so much beauty and style content out there in the Wild World Web. It lives on personal blogs, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest... many different platforms. I was curious to experiment with ideas for a platform specifically designed for that type of content. I wanted to push aside traditional social media formats: blog post, photo post, video postâ€”and create new formats. What would an experience for creating a makeup tutorial be like? Or a style compilation?

I have identified a list of post types I wanted to focus on:

- Style snapshot
- Product review
- Photo tutorial
- Video tutorial
- Article

I wanted the platform to be an interactive and personal experience. Beauty and style brands could use this platform to reach out to targeted audiences, and reward the most active users with samples and exclusive access to early releases. I ran a test landing page with a signup and a survey to collect feedback.
