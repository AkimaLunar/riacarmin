Treilla is all about making the big data serve for the benefit of users and businesses. With all that data the question was how do you use it to connect people with what they like. Take a look at our info sheet.

>The solution was to use the power of social data mining

We wanted to build an intelligent recommendation engine that mines social data and gives users what they want at exact time they need it. Explore the app in your browser or download it on your iPad.

<strong>Shadowing</strong> The initial idea was to build a platform for small business owners to help them find local customers. I've spent the entire day shadowing small business workers to understand their daily routine. By the end of the day there was one thing I knew for sure: they don’t have to time for marketing. They are too busy making awesome stuff for you!

The solution was to use the power of social data mining to deliver results to small business owners, and at the same time providing users with relevant recommendations at any given time or location.

>We were dealing with data from different sources and different types

<strong>Information architecture</strong> was crucial. The way we organized the data would have defined the user experience. We were dealing with data from different sources and different types: places, events, promotions… After looking into different data samples we came up with categorization that would make this data relevant to user.

<strong>Design</strong> The final app layout that I designed was an infinite stream of recommendations that accounted for users’ preferences, time of the day, their location and type of business. Everything that users liked or searched for would improve the quality of future recommendations. It its final iteration Treilla became a guide to the city as personalized as it could be.
