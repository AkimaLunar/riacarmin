<em class="text--emphasize">The idea of reLabel.it started with the founder’s frustration with food labels. Even though we were not the first to try to solve the problem of translating confusing nutrition fact labels, we took a completely different approach in design.</em>

We didn’t want just to make a regular labels better, we wanted to create an app that would provide users with completely different experience, simple, personalized and intuitive grocery shopping assistant. Check out the final design of the concept our team came up with.

Occupy Whole Foods When I started working on this project, the first question I had in mind was “what do people really look for in food labels?” So I took the entire team to Whole Foods to observe shoppers and engage in casual conversations about food quality and diet.

>What do people really look for in food labels?

The first important thing I noticed was that people really did read food labels. So I would come up to them and ask what information they were trying to find. It was amazing how responsive people were when I said that I was trying to design a “food label translator”.

Seeing Patterns After a day spent in Whole Foods our team had tons of notes and quite a few stories. When sharing our findings, it became clear that there were definitely patterns in what people were trying to find in food labels.

So we just started to put words that we heard people say a lot on sticky notes and arranging them in some basic mental model. There were definitely three different types of shoppers that could be our potential users: people with health concerns like diabetics, vegetarians and vegans, and health conscious shoppers.

>There were three patterns of what people were looking for in food labels… That is exactly what we wanted to highlight in our app

Mental model and three personas that we created became the basis for the app. All existing apps at that moment didn’t solve the problem of making shopping easier. We wanted to help people by building an app that would highlight what is important for a specific user and her concerns.

There were three patterns of what people were looking for in food labels: ingredients they could absolutely not have because of specific health conditions or diet, ingredients that they tried not to consume, like artificial colorings and preservatives, and finally ratios, like sugar to fiber and good fat to bad fat. That is exactly what we wanted to highlight in our app.

>We wanted to make it as simple as “Yes, buy it”, or “No, it has soy”

Buy or Not to Buy Through customization flow users could choose their diet preferences and concerns, and the app would automatically look for specific ingredients in food labels giving the users just the information they needed. We wanted to make it as simple as “Yes, buy it”, or “No, it has soy”.

It was very important to me to apply our research and findings to the final design. That is why specific food concerns were the first thing users would see after scanning a label. The ratio of bad fat to carbs and fiber to sugar come next, and finally other commonly tracked ingredients, like sodium and proteins.
