Sweeble is an Android and iOS application that has introduced an alternative to a traditional binary “like” or “not-like”. Sweeble has experimented with an idea of “like intensity”, allowing users to express which content they like the most.

>…alternative to a traditional binary “like” or “not-like”

<div class="figure__container">
<figure class="figure__2 figure__centered">
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/sweeble/animation.gif" style="width: 300px; display: block; margin: 0 auto;" alt="“Like” animation">
  <figcaption>“Like” animation. Hold to show how much you like it, and the animation will change.</figcaption>
</figure>

My goal was to design an onboarding experience that would convert well, but also allow the users to explore the platform. The final onboarding flow gives enough access to the content for users to get a feel for what the application is about and engage with their friends, but also prompt them to create an account for deeper engagement.

The best onboarding experience allows users to start using the application with minimal time to set up, and prompt to create an account only when needed. It is important for user retention to allow basic functionality before sign up, which decreases the initial drop out.
